# Pong-Clone
It's a Pong clone written entirely in Python with the Pygame modual.

In my push to start myself with learning Python, I followed a few tutorials and managed to create a fully functional, (allbeit, a very primitive) clone of Pong. It's very basic, but it has started me off and I am now focusing on expanding my knowledge and understanding of the Python language.

A long winded way of saying, don't expect much, because it isn't.
